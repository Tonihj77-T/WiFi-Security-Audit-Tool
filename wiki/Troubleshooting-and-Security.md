# Troubleshooting and Security Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

### Service Issues

- **Service doesn't start**: 
  - Check the logs with `journalctl -u wifi_security_audit.service`
  - Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
  - Ensure the configuration file exists and is properly formatted
  - Check file permissions on script files

- **Service starts but doesn't process files**:
  - Verify that the monitor directory exists and has correct permissions
  - Check if the authorization requirement is enabled and if valid authorization files exist
  - Review logs for specific error messages

### Email Notification Issues

- **Email is not sent**: 
  - Check the GMX credentials in the configuration file
  - Verify SMTP settings (server and port)
  - Test network connectivity to the email server
  - Check if your email provider requires specific security settings

### Analysis Issues

- **Analysis fails or times out**:
  - Ensure the handshake file is valid and contains a complete handshake
  - Check if the wordlist file exists and is accessible
  - Verify that aircrack-ng and hashcat are properly installed
  - Try increasing the timeout value for complex analyses

- **Password not found**:
  - This could be expected behavior if the password is strong
  - Try using a more comprehensive wordlist
  - Check if the handshake capture is complete and valid

### Authorization Issues

- **Authorization checks fail**:
  - Ensure the authorization file follows the correct format
  - Verify that the SSID in the authorization matches the network being analyzed
  - Check file permissions on the authorization directory and files

## Security Best Practices for WiFi Networks

The following recommendations can help improve the security of WiFi networks:

### Protocol and Encryption

- **Use WPA3 when possible**: 
  - WPA3 provides stronger encryption and protection against brute force attacks
  - If WPA3 is not available, use WPA2 with AES/CCMP (not TKIP)
  - Avoid WEP and WPA1 as they are severely compromised

- **Disable WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)**:
  - WPS is vulnerable to brute force attacks
  - This feature should be disabled in the router settings

### Password Security

- **Create strong passwords**:
  - Use at least 12 characters
  - Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Avoid common words, phrases, or patterns
  - Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords

- **Change passwords regularly**:
  - Update your WiFi password every 3-6 months
  - Always change passwords after suspected security incidents

### Network Configuration

- **Update router firmware**:
  - Check for and apply router firmware updates regularly
  - Updates often contain security patches for known vulnerabilities

- **Implement network segregation**:
  - Create separate guest networks for visitors
  - Use VLANs to separate IoT devices from your main network
  - Enable client isolation on guest networks

- **Use MAC address filtering**:
  - While not foolproof, this adds an additional layer of security
  - Maintain a list of authorized devices

- **Disable remote management**:
  - Turn off remote management features unless absolutely necessary
  - If needed, use secure methods like VPN

- **Change default settings**:
  - Modify the default SSID to not reveal router model
  - Change default admin credentials
  - Disable SSID broadcast for private networks (with caution)

## Educational Purpose and Ethical Use

This tool was designed to promote understanding of WiFi security and to assist network administrators in identifying vulnerabilities. Knowledge of potential security vulnerabilities is crucial for implementing effective protective measures.

All use of this tool should be:
- Legal and authorized
- Educational or protective in nature
- Conducted with respect for privacy and security
- Properly documented and logged

Remember that security assessment tools like this should only be used to improve security posture, not to compromise networks without authorization.
