## Welcome to the WiFi-Security-Audit-Tool wiki!

This wiki provides comprehensive documentation for the WiFi Security Audit Tool, a system designed for legitimate security assessment of WiFi networks.

## About the Tool

The WiFi Security Audit Tool enables network administrators, security professionals, and educators to evaluate the security of wireless networks in a controlled, ethical, and legal manner. The system analyzes captured handshake files to identify potential vulnerabilities and provides detailed reports with actionable recommendations.

### Key Components

- **Security Audit Tool**: Automated system that monitors for handshake files, performs security analysis, and generates detailed reports
- **Dictionary Generator**: Creates customized wordlists for thorough security assessment

## Important Legal Notice

**This tool is intended exclusively for legitimate purposes:**
- Assessing security of your own networks
- Performing authorized penetration tests with explicit written permission
- Educational use in controlled environments

Unauthorized use of this tool to access networks without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions and violates ethical standards of security research.

## Quick Start

After installation, you'll need to:

1. Configure the email settings in `/etc/wifi_security_audit/config.ini`
2. Ensure you have proper authorization documentation in place
3. Place handshake files in the monitoring directory
4. Review the security reports sent via email


## Security Best Practices

We strongly advocate for implementing robust security measures in WiFi networks:

- Use WPA3 encryption where possible
- Create strong, unique passwords (12+ characters)
- Implement network segmentation
- Keep router firmware updated
- Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
