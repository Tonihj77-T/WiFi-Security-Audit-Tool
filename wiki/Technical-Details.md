# Technical Details

## Security Audit Tool

The `security_audit_tool.py` is the core component that:

1. **Monitoring Functionality**:
   - Continuously monitors a specified directory for new handshake files
   - Processes files as they appear and removes them after analysis
   - Runs as a systemd service with proper isolation

2. **Authorization Verification**:
   - Checks for valid authorization documents before processing
   - Extracts SSID and MAC address from handshake files
   - Matches them against authorization records
   - Logs all authorization attempts for audit purposes

3. **Security Analysis**:
   - Automatically detects and converts between different handshake formats
   - Uses both aircrack-ng and hashcat for comprehensive analysis
   - Implements timeout mechanisms to prevent excessive resource usage
   - Supports different security protocols (WPA/WPA2/WPA3)

4. **Reporting System**:
   - Generates detailed security reports based on findings
   - Sends email notifications with assessment results
   - Provides recommendations for security improvements
   - Includes educational information in educational mode

5. **Safety Measures**:
   - Authorization verification before processing
   - Local network validation
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Resource consumption limits

## Dictionary Generator

The `dictionary_generator.py` creates customized word lists for security assessment:

1. **Customization Options**:
   - Character set selection (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special)
   - Minimum and maximum password length configuration
   - Base word incorporation from external files
   - Pattern generation with common password structures

2. **Optimization Features**:
   - Batch processing for large dictionaries
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Memory usage optimizations for large dictionaries
   - Safety limits to prevent excessive resource consumption

3. **Pattern Generation**:
   - Year combinations (1990-2029)
   - Common suffix additions (123, !, #, etc.)
   - First letter capitalization
   - Custom pattern rules can be extended

## System Architecture

The system implements a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Main Service**:
   - Runs as a systemd service with appropriate isolation
   - Uses daemon context for background operation
   - Implements proper signal handling and cleanup

2. **File Processing Pipeline**:
   - Monitoring → Authorization → Analysis → Reporting
   - Each stage with proper error handling and logging
   - Format conversion handled transparently

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Centralized configuration file
   - Secure storage of sensitive settings
   - Runtime parameter overrides

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Runs with minimal required privileges
   - Audit logging of all operations
   - Authorization enforcement
   - Network isolation options
